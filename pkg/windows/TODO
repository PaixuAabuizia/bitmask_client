TODO
====

fix python-code (0.9.1) that fails on windows:
- fix the race condition for the backend/frontend startup.
  spawning the backend takes time. with a introduced 15s timeout
  it was possible to ensure the backend is up. It would be ideal
  if the backend could signal the app to continue loading the frontend
- fix the ~/leap/events/zmq_certificates/public_keys/server.key
- fix logger (& remove hack in pyinstaller-build.sh:228)
- fix pysqlcipher (/LIB:,https get not working in setup.py, remove hack
  in pyinstaller-build:164)
- merge bitmask_root from https://github.com/alirezamirzaeiyan/bitmask-root

create similar infrastructure for osx dmg, preferably run on osx for compressed dmg
